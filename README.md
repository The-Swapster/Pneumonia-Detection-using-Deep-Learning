# Pneumonia-Detection-using-Deep-Learning

**Aim:** Comparative study of CNN and MLP for pneumonia detection
**Steps**
* Reading training, testing, and validation dataset
* Normalising the dataset and reshaping it
* Performing augmentation to increase the size
* Model development
  * Multi Layer Perceptron
  * Convolutional Neural Network
* Evaluating the models
  * Accuracy
  * Precision
  * Recall
  * F1 score
  * Confusion Matrix
* Selecting best model
* Developing GUI using Tkinter using best model

**Conclusion**
* CNN is the best performing model
* Dataset consists of pediatric chest x-ray dataset
* Study could be extended for detecting COVID-19
* Dataset with more samples would lead help attain better results
